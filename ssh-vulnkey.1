.Sh NAME
.Nm ssh-vulnkey
.Nd check blacklist of compromised keys
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl q
.Ar file ...
.Nm
.Fl a
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
checks a key against a blacklist of compromised keys.
.Pp
A substantial number of keys are known to have been generated using a broken
version of OpenSSL distributed by Debian which failed to seed its random
number generator correctly.
Keys generated using these OpenSSL versions should be assumed to be
compromised.
This tool may be useful in checking for such keys.
.Pp
Keys that are compromised cannot be repaired; replacements must be generated
using
.Xr ssh-keygen 1 .
Make sure to update
.Pa authorized_keys
files on all systems where compromised keys were permitted to authenticate.
.Pp
The argument list will be interpreted as a list of paths to public key files
or
.Pa authorized_keys
files.
If no suitable file is found at a given path,
.Nm
will append
.Pa .pub
and retry, in case it was given a private key file.
If no files are given as arguments,
.Nm
will check
.Pa ~/.ssh/id_rsa ,
.Pa ~/.ssh/id_dsa ,
.Pa ~/.ssh/identity ,
.Pa ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
and
.Pa ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 ,
as well as the system's host keys if readable.
.Pp
If
.Dq -
is given as an argument,
.Nm
will read from standard input.
This can be used to process output from
.Xr ssh-keyscan 1 ,
for example:
.Pp
.Dl $ ssh-keyscan -t rsa remote.example.org | ssh-vulnkey -
.Pp
.Nm
will exit zero if any of the given keys were in the compromised list,
otherwise non-zero.
.Pp
Unless the
.Cm PermitBlacklistedKeys
option is used,
.Xr sshd 8
will reject attempts to authenticate with keys in the compromised list.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Check keys of all users on the system.
You will typically need to run
.Nm
as root to use this option.
For each user,
.Nm
will check
.Pa ~/.ssh/id_rsa ,
.Pa ~/.ssh/id_dsa ,
.Pa ~/.ssh/identity ,
.Pa ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
and
.Pa ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 .
It will also check the system's host keys.
.It Fl q
Quiet mode.
Normally,
.Nm
outputs the fingerprint of each key scanned, with a description of its
status.
This option suppresses that output.
.El
.Sh BLACKLIST FILE FORMAT
The blacklist file may start with comments, on lines starting with
.Dq # .
After these initial comments, it must follow a strict format:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -offset indent -compact
.It
All the lines must be exactly the same length (20 characters followed by a
newline) and must be in sorted order.
.It
Each line must consist of the lower-case hexadecimal MD5 key fingerprint,
without colons, and with the first 12 characters removed (that is, the least
significant 80 bits of the fingerprint).
.El
.Pp
The key fingerprint may be generated using
.Xr ssh-keygen 1 :
.Pp
.Dl $ ssh-keygen -l -f /path/to/key
.Pp
This strict format is necessary to allow the blacklist file to be checked
quickly, using a binary-search algorithm.

Florian Weimer suggested the option to check keys of all users, and the idea
of processing
.Xr ssh-keyscan 1
output.
