msgid ""
"Previous versions of openssh-server permitted logging in as root over SSH "
"using password authentication. The default for new installations is now "
"\"PermitRootLogin prohibit-password\", which disables password "
"authentication for root without breaking systems that have explicitly "
"configured SSH public key authentication for root."

msgid ""
"This change makes systems more secure against brute-force password "
"dictionary attacks on the root user (a very common target for such attacks). "
"However, it may break systems that are set up with the expectation of being "
"able to SSH as root using password authentication. You should only make this "
"change if you do not need to do that."

msgid ""
"This version of openssh-server uses socket-based activation, which means "
"ListenAddress settings in sshd_config have been migrated to ListenStream "
"settings in /etc/systemd/system/ssh.socket.d/addresses.conf. If one of the "
"ListenAddress values configured in sshd is not available, sshd will still "
"listen on any remaining configured addresses; but if one of the addresses "
"configured in ListenStream is not available, the systemd socket unit will "
"fail to start."
msgstr ""

#. Type: error
#. Description
#: ../openssh-server.templates:3001
msgid ""
"You have more than one ListenAddress configured in sshd_config, which means "
"it is possible that sshd starts successfully on your system, but will fail "
"to start on reboot because one of the addresses is unavailable to bind to.  "
"Because an address may become available late in the boot process, it is not "
"possible to determine during upgrade whether sshd will or will not start on "
"reboot."

#. Type: error
#. Description
#: ../openssh-server.templates:3001
msgid ""
"If you rely on sshd for access to this system, you should examine /etc/"
"systemd/system/ssh.socket.d/addresses.conf prior to reboot and make any "
"necessary corrections to ensure the availability of the system."

#. Type: error
#. Description
#: ../openssh-server.templates:3001
msgid ""
"The surest way to guarantee that ssh.socket will start after reboot is to "
"remove /etc/systemd/system/ssh.socket.d/addresses.conf entirely and allow "
"systemd to bind to all addresses."
msgstr ""

#. Type: error
#. Description
#: ../openssh-server.templates:3001
msgid ""
"If you must limit the addresses that ssh binds to but cannot ensure these "
"addresses are available before the socket unit starts, you can revert to not "
"using socket-based activation for sshd.  See /usr/share/doc/openssh-server/"
"README.Debian.gz for more information."
