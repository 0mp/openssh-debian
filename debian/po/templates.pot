"Password authentication appears to be disabled in the current OpenSSH server "
"configuration. In order to prevent users from logging in using passwords "
"(perhaps using only public key authentication instead) with recent versions "

"If you disable challenge-response authentication, then users will not be "
"able to log in using passwords. If you leave it enabled (the default "
"answer), then the 'PasswordAuthentication no' option will have no useful "
