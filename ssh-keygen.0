^[[1mDESCRIPTION^[[0m
     ^[[1msshM-bM-^@M-^Pkeygen ^[[22mgenerates, manages and converts authentication keys for
     ssh(1).  ^[[1msshM-bM-^@M-^Pkeygen ^[[22mcan create RSA keys for use by SSH protocol version 1
     and RSA or DSA keys for use by SSH protocol version 2. The type of key to
     be generated is specified with the ^[[1mM-bMM-^Rt ^[[22moption.

     Normally each user wishing to use SSH with RSA or DSA authentication runs
     this once to create the authentication key in ^[[4m$HOME/.ssh/identity^[[24m,
     ^[[4m$HOME/.ssh/id_dsa^[[24m or ^[[4m$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa^[[24m.  Additionally, the system adminM-bM-^@M-^P
     istrator may use this to generate host keys, as seen in ^[[4m/etc/rc^[[24m.

     Normally this program generates the key and asks for a file in which to
     store the private key.  The public key is stored in a file with the same
     name but M-bM-^@M-^\.pubM-bM-^@M-^] appended.  The program also asks for a passphrase.  The
     passphrase may be empty to indicate no passphrase (host keys must have an
     empty passphrase), or it may be a string of arbitrary length.  A
     passphrase is similar to a password, except it can be a phrase with a
     series of words, punctuation, numbers, whitespace, or any string of charM-bM-^@M-^P
     acters you want.  Good passphrases are 10M-bM-^@M-^P30 characters long, are not
     simple sentences or otherwise easily guessable (English prose has only
     1M-bM-^@M-^P2 bits of entropy per character, and provides very bad passphrases),
     and contain a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and nonM-bM-^@M-^P
     alphanumeric characters.  The passphrase can be changed later by using
     the ^[[1mM-bMM-^Rp ^[[22moption.

     There is no way to recover a lost passphrase.  If the passphrase is lost
     or forgotten, a new key must be generated and copied to the corresponding
     public key to other machines.

     For RSA1 keys, there is also a comment field in the key file that is only
     for convenience to the user to help identify the key.  The comment can
     tell what the key is for, or whatever is useful.  The comment is initialM-bM-^@M-^P
     ized to M-bM-^@M-^\user@hostM-bM-^@M-^] when the key is created, but can be changed using the
     ^[[1mM-bMM-^Rc ^[[22moption.

     After a key is generated, instructions below detail where the keys should
     be placed to be activated.

     The options are as follows:

     ^[[1mM-bMM-^Rb ^[[4m^[[22mbits^[[0m
             Specifies the number of bits in the key to create.  Minimum is
             512 bits.  Generally, 1024 bits is considered sufficient.  The
             default is 1024 bits.

     ^[[1mM-bMM-^Rc      ^[[22mRequests changing the comment in the private and public key
             files.  This operation is only supported for RSA1 keys.  The proM-bM-^@M-^P
             gram will prompt for the file containing the private keys, for
             the passphrase if the key has one, and for the new comment.

     ^[[1mM-bMM-^Re      ^[[22mThis option will read a private or public OpenSSH key file and
             print the key in a M-bM-^@M-^XSECSH Public Key File FormatM-bM-^@M-^Y to stdout.
             This option allows exporting keys for use by several commercial
             SSH implementations.

     ^[[1mM-bMM-^Rf ^[[4m^[[22mfilename^[[0m
             Specifies the filename of the key file.

     ^[[1mM-bMM-^Ri      ^[[22mThis option will read an unencrypted private (or public) key file
             in SSH2M-bM-^@M-^Pcompatible format and print an OpenSSH compatible private
             (or public) key to stdout.  ^[[1msshM-bM-^@M-^Pkeygen ^[[22malso reads the M-bM-^@M-^XSECSH
             Public Key File FormatM-bM-^@M-^Y.  This option allows importing keys from
             several commercial SSH implementations.

     ^[[1mM-bMM-^Rl      ^[[22mShow fingerprint of specified public key file.  Private RSA1 keys
             are also supported.  For RSA and DSA keys ^[[1msshM-bM-^@M-^Pkeygen ^[[22mtries to
             find the matching public key file and prints its fingerprint.

     ^[[1mM-bMM-^Rp      ^[[22mRequests changing the passphrase of a private key file instead of
             creating a new private key.  The program will prompt for the file
             containing the private key, for the old passphrase, and twice for
             the new passphrase.

     ^[[1mM-bMM-^Rq      ^[[22mSilence ^[[1msshM-bM-^@M-^Pkeygen^[[22m.  Used by ^[[4m/etc/rc^[[24m when creating a new key.

     ^[[1mM-bMM-^Ry      ^[[22mThis option will read a private OpenSSH format file and print an
             OpenSSH public key to stdout.

     ^[[1mM-bMM-^Rt ^[[4m^[[22mtype^[[0m
             Specifies the type of the key to create.  The possible values are
             M-bM-^@M-^\rsa1M-bM-^@M-^] for protocol version 1 and M-bM-^@M-^\rsaM-bM-^@M-^] or M-bM-^@M-^\dsaM-bM-^@M-^] for protocol
             version 2.

     ^[[1mM-bMM-^RB      ^[[22mShow the bubblebabble digest of specified private or public key
             file.

     ^[[1mM-bMM-^RC ^[[4m^[[22mcomment^[[0m
             Provides the new comment.

     ^[[1mM-bMM-^RD ^[[4m^[[22mreader^[[0m
             Download the RSA public key stored in the smartcard in ^[[4mreader^[[24m.

     ^[[1mM-bMM-^RN ^[[4m^[[22mnew_passphrase^[[0m
             Provides the new passphrase.

     ^[[1mM-bMM-^RP ^[[4m^[[22mpassphrase^[[0m
             Provides the (old) passphrase.

     ^[[1mM-bMM-^RU ^[[4m^[[22mreader^[[0m
             Upload an existing RSA private key into the smartcard in ^[[4mreader^[[24m.
