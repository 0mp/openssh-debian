^[[1mNAME^[[0m
     ^[[1msshM-bM-^@M-^Pkeysign ^[[22mM-bMM-^R ssh helper program for hostbased authentication

^[[1mSYNOPSIS^[[0m
     ^[[1msshM-bM-^@M-^Pkeysign^[[0m

^[[1mDESCRIPTION^[[0m
     ^[[1msshM-bM-^@M-^Pkeysign ^[[22mis used by ssh(1) to access the local host keys and generate
     the digital signature required during hostbased authentication with SSH
     protocol version 2.

     ^[[1msshM-bM-^@M-^Pkeysign ^[[22mis disabled by default and can only be enabled in the global
     client configuration file ^[[4m/etc/ssh/ssh_config^[[24m by setting ^[[1mEnableSSHKeysign^[[0m
     to M-bM-^@M-^\yesM-bM-^@M-^].

     ^[[1msshM-bM-^@M-^Pkeysign ^[[22mis not intended to be invoked by the user, but from ssh(1).
     See ssh(1) and sshd(8) for more information about hostbased authenticaM-bM-^@M-^P
     tion.

^[[1mFILES^[[0m
     /etc/ssh/ssh_config
             Controls whether ^[[1msshM-bM-^@M-^Pkeysign ^[[22mis enabled.

     /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key, /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
             These files contain the private parts of the host keys used to
             generate the digital signature.  They should be owned by root,
             readable only by root, and not accessible to others.  Since they
             are readable only by root, ^[[1msshM-bM-^@M-^Pkeysign ^[[22mmust be setM-bM-^@M-^Puid root if
             hostbased authentication is used.
